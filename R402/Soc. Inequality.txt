CHAT GPT PROMPT - IT IS KINDA MISSLEADING 
Below are ready-to-use, concise analysis and interpretation templates organized by your three main topics, using only the variables you listed. Each item gives: which variables to report, what comparisons/hypotheses to make, what a meaningful result would imply, and short sentence templates you can copy into Results and Discussion (fill with your numbers).

I. Labour market

    Variables to use
        Outcomes: WAGE, OCCUPATION, WORK_CONDITIONS, EMPLOYMENT (derive: OCCUPATION==5 → unemployed)
        Controls/mediators: GENDER, EDU, AGE, TOWN, HH, DIPLOMA_GAP, CAR, PC, FARMING
        Additional context: BOOKS, TV, RADIO as SES proxies

    Descriptive comparisons
        Report: mean/median WAGE by GENDER; distribution of OCCUPATION by GENDER; mean WORK_CONDITIONS by GENDER; EDU distribution by GENDER; share in Sofia vs villages by GENDER.
        Hypotheses to test (simple language):
            Men have higher mean wages than women.
            Men are more represented in higher OCCUPATION categories (1–2), women more in lower categories (3–5).
            Women report worse WORK_CONDITIONS on average.
            Controlling for EDU, AGE, TOWN, HH, DIPLOMA_GAP, CAR, PC and FARMING will reduce but may not eliminate gender gaps.

    Interpretation rules (how to read results)
        If EDU_female ≥ EDU_male but WAGE_female < WAGE_male after controls → unequal returns to education; suggest structural barriers.
        If OCCUPATION distribution explains most of the wage gap → occupational segregation is primary channel.
        If DIPLOMA_GAP is higher for women and predicts lower WAGE → credential mismatch constrains women’s earnings.
        If rural (TOWN>1) concentration explains gaps → spatial labor-market structure and mobility (CAR) matter.

    Result sentence templates
        Descriptive: "Median monthly wage was X for men and Y for women; the raw gender wage gap was Z%."
        Occupation: "X% of men vs Y% of women occupied manager/senior roles (OCCUPATION 1–2), while Y% of women were unemployed (OCCUPATION 5)."
        Adjusted: "After adjusting for EDU, AGE, TOWN, HH, DIPLOMA_GAP, CAR, PC and FARMING, the female wage coefficient was β (p = ), implying an adjusted gap of g%."
        Mechanism: "Including OCCUPATION reduces the wage gap by Δ%, indicating occupational sorting explains a substantial share."

II. Household chores

    Variables to use
        Outcomes: HOUSEHOLD_WORK (1–4 intensity)
        Controls/mediators: GENDER, HH, AGE, OCCUPATION, WAGE, EDU, FARMING, CAR, PC, TOWN

    Descriptive comparisons
        Report: distribution of HOUSEHOLD_WORK by GENDER; median HOUSEHOLD_WORK by HH size; cross-tab HOUSEHOLD_WORK × OCCUPATION.
        Hypotheses:
            Women report higher HOUSEHOLD_WORK intensity than men.
            Larger HH and presence of FARMING associate with higher HOUSEHOLD_WORK.
            High household burden correlates with lower WAGE and lower-status OCCUPATION, particularly for women.

    Interpretation rules
        If women do substantially more household work and that variable predicts lower WAGE or higher probability of lower OCCUPATION, treat household burden as a mechanism for labour-market inequality.
        If CAR or PC ownership is associated with lower HOUSEHOLD_WORK and higher female labour-market outcomes, treat assets as mitigating factors.

    Result sentence templates
        Descriptive: "X% of women vs Y% of men reported high household-work intensity (HOUSEHOLD_WORK=4). Median household size was M; among households with >M members, the share reporting high household work rose to S%."
        Link to labour market: "Respondents with high household-work intensity earned on average Z% less and were more likely to be in lower OCCUPATION categories; the pattern was stronger for women."

III. Research and development (R&D)

    Variables to use
        Outcomes: RESEARCH_ACT (1=no, 2=yes)
        Controls/mediators: GENDER, EDU, AGE, OCCUPATION, TOWN, PC, BOOKS, DIPLOMA_GAP, WORK_CONDITIONS

    Descriptive comparisons
        Report: share R&D-active by GENDER; R&D share by EDU and TOWN (Sofia vs others); average PC and BOOKS among R&D-active persons by GENDER.
        Hypotheses:
            Men are more likely to be RESEARCH_ACT=2 than women.
            Higher EDU and Sofia residence increase probability of R&D activity.
            After controlling for EDU, OCCUPATION, PC and BOOKS, a residual gender gap indicates institutional barriers.

    Interpretation rules
        If EDU-equal women have significantly lower R&D participation → evidence of exclusion or unequal pipeline progression.
        If RESEARCH_ACT concentrated in Sofia and women are underrepresented in Sofia-based occupations, emphasize spatial/institutional barriers.

    Result sentence templates
        Descriptive: "Overall, X% of respondents were R&D-active: Y% of men vs Z% of women."
        Adjusted: "Controlling for EDU, OCCUPATION, AGE, TOWN, PC and BOOKS, women had an adjusted odds ratio of OR (95% CI) for R&D activity compared to men."
        Mechanism: "DIPLOMA_GAP and lack of PC access explained part of the gender difference; an unexplained residual suggests institutional constraints."

IV. Cross-domain synthesis and conclusions

    Comparative logic
        Report three summary facts: (a) raw gender gaps in WAGE/OCCUPATION/RESEARCH_ACT/HOUSEHOLD_WORK, (b) how much each gap shrinks after adjusting for EDU, OCCUPATION, HOUSEHOLD variables, TOWN, and assets (CAR/PC/BOOKS), (c) what residuals remain.
        Use Oaxaca–Blinder style language even if not performing exact decomposition: "X% of the raw wage gap is explained by observable factors; the remaining Y% is unexplained."

    Final interpretation templates
        If substantial unexplained residuals across domains: "Women in late-1980s Bulgaria faced persistent disadvantages in pay, occupational status, and R&D participation that are not fully accounted for by education, household composition, location, or assets — suggesting structural barriers and unequal returns to qualifications."
        If gaps largely explained by household and spatial variables: "Gender differences in labour-market outcomes largely reflect household-care burdens and spatial/sectoral distributions; policies easing care responsibilities and decentralizing R&D could reduce inequality."
        Emphasize links: "Unequal household-work burden helps reproduce occupational segregation, which in turn depresses wages and reduces women’s access to R&D roles."

V. Practical checklist for writing Results (use these lines and insert your figures)

    Start with sample profile: "Sample size N; share female = F%; mean age = A; share in Sofia = S%."
    Labour market block: present a small table (or sentences) with median WAGE by gender, OCCUPATION shares, mean EDU by gender, mean DIPLOMA_GAP by gender.
    Household chores block: present HOUSEHOLD_WORK distribution by gender and HH size; link to WAGE/OCCUPATION.
    R&D block: present RESEARCH_ACT shares by gender and EDU; show PC/BOOKS differences.
    Adjusted results: report one sentence per domain summarizing the adjusted gender effect (e.g., adjusted wage gap, adjusted odds ratio for R&D, adjusted odds for high household work).
    Conclude with one short paragraph summarizing mechanisms and policy implications.

If you want, I can now:

    Generate exact one-paragraph Result drafts for each domain with placeholders (X, Y, β, OR) you can replace with your estimates, or
    Create brief table captions and figure captions matched to the variables above. Which do you prefer?
